Following coaching, training, and a financial boost of 10 million Rwf from Imbuto Foundation\u2019s Imali Agribusiness Challenge, Gildas began to reshape his business with a newfound clarity and purpose.<\/p><p>By truly understanding his customers and their needs, he was able to craft strategies that significantly improved engagement and service. As a result, Gildas successfully completed two mushroom production phases, leading to a substantial increase in sales of both mushroom tubes and fresh mushrooms. This growth not only boosted his business but also created job opportunities for 5 permanent employees and up to 25 casual workers, depending on the season.<\/p><p>Gildas also became more skilled in managing financial resources, allowing him to achieve his short-term goals on time. One of his most impressive accomplishments was using his sales income to purchase a 4,300-square-meter plot of land\u2014a milestone that once seemed out of reach when he first joined the programme. Additionally, he generated an impressive 9 million Rwf from goods, which further fueled his business growth. This land acquisition provided a solid foundation for his future production premises, overcoming one of his biggest challenges and setting the stage for continued growth and success.<\/p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Agriculture The Agriculture programme is dedicated to improving the lives of women and youth by promoting income-generating activities.
